    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 3L water in a big pot and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Soak the dried shrimp in 1 cup of hot water for about 20 mins.</li>
        <li>Fry the prawn heads with some oil in a separate shallow pot until they are dry and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Once the prawn heads are dry and fragrant, add some boiling water (part of the 3L water) and use a potato masher to press the prawn heads. This will help to release even more fragrance out from the heads.</li>
        <li>Add the prawn heads and prawn stock to the rest of the boiling water in the pot.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to low or medium low and simmer the stock with the lid on for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Use a food processor or pestle and mortar to chop or pound the dried shrimp into fine pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the water used to soften the dried shrimp into the stock to make it even more fragrant.</li>
        <li>Blend shallots first in a food processor so that you get some juice out to make blending of the other ingredients easier. You can also use the pestle and mortar to do this step.</li>
        <li>Then add garlic, fresh red chilli, dried chilli, lemongrass, turmeric, candlenut, galangal in the food processor and blend for a while until they are finely chopped up.</li>
        <li>Finally, add water, grounded coriander powder and roasted belachan into the processor with the other spices and blend them into a paste.</li>
        <li>Heat up some oil in a pan and fry the rempah paste until it is dark red in colour. This step may take about up to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the rempah paste is dark red in colour, add the chopped dried shrimp and continue to fry until they are mixed well into the rempah paste.</li>
        <li>Remove the prawn heads from the stock and add rempah paste into the pot.</li>
        <li>Bring the stock to a boil then add coconut milk. Stir as you add the coconut milk.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to medium or medium low then add beancurd puff (taupok) and bring the stock to a soft boil.</li>
        <li>Once the stock has come to a soft boil, add some salt and sugar to season it according to your taste.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, cook some yellow noodles or thick vermicelli and drain them well.</li>
        <li>To serve, put some noodles or vermicelli in a bowl and add laksa stock. Serve the noodles with hard-boiled egg, fish cake and cooked prawns. Garnish with some laksa leaves (optional) and serve hot.</li>
